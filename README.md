# CriminalIntent
CriminalIntent records the details of "office crimes".

Make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. Identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook, or another app.

This project is the most important example project of the book <Android Programming(2nd edition)>. 

I've acomplished all the practices all by myself and fix bugs I've found for now.
